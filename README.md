**GeForce Infinity** is a work-in-progress application designed to enhance the GeForce NOW experience.

Our goal is to refine the user interface and offer custom features for an improved experience.

## 🚀 **Features**

- **Enhanced UI**: GeForce Infinity aims to improve the user interface of GeForce NOW, providing a more intuitive and enjoyable experience.
- **Custom Discord Rich Presence**: Show off your gaming status with personalized Discord Rich Presence. Display game details and status updates directly in your Discord profile.

## 🛠️ **Planned Features**

We have several exciting features planned to further enhance your experience:

- **Game Icon in Discord RPC**: Display a small icon representing the game you’re playing in Discord Rich Presence.
  
- **Account Switching**: Easily switch between different GeForce NOW accounts within the app.
  
- **Automatic Game Startup**: Customize which game starts automatically when the app launches.
  
- **Instant App Switch**: Automatically switch to GeForce Infinity once your gaming rig is ready for action.
